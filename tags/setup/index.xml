      <description>As I know, there are few choices to connect from R to MS SQL Server:
 RODBC RJDBC rsqlserver  But only second option can be used on mac and linux machines. Here is nice stackoverflow thread.
Most of the people suggest to use microsoft sql java driver. But there is a case when this will not help - windows domain authentification. In this situation I found the only working solution is to use nice jTDS.</description>

      <description>The main purpose of this post is to keep all steps of installing cuda toolkit (and R related packages) and in one place. Also I hope this may be useful for someone.
Installing cuda toolkit ( Ubuntu ) First of all we need to install nvidia cuda toolkti. I&amp;rsquo;am on latest ubuntu 15.04, but found this article well suited for me. But there are few additions:
 It is very important to have no nvidia drivers before installation ( first I corrupted my system and have to reinstall it :-( ).</description>
