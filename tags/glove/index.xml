      <description>Before reading this post, I very recommend to read:
 Orignal GloVe paper Jon Gauthier&amp;rsquo;s post, which provides detailed explanation of python implementation. This post helps me a lot with C++ implementation.  Word embeddings After Tomas Mikolov et al. released word2vec tool, there was a boom of articles about words vector representations. One of the greatest is GloVe, which did a big thing by explaining how such algorithms work.</description>

      <description>Today I will start to publish series of posts about experiments on english wikipedia. As I said before, text2vec is inspired by gensim - well designed and quite efficient python library for topic modeling and related NLP tasks. Also I found very useful Radim&amp;rsquo;s posts, where he tried to evaluate some algorithms on english wikipedia dump. This dataset is rather big. For example, dump for 2015-10 (which will be used below) is 12gb bzip2 compressed file.</description>
